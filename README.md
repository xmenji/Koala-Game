# Koala-Game

Koalabr8 is a game written in Java done for my CSC 413 Software Development class.

The objective of the game is to get all of your koalas to the exit and rescue them. The player starts off with four koalas which all move at the same time so the player is required to strategize how to rescue each koala while avoiding each hazard.
